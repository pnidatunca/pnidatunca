I'm a **Computer Engineering student** with a strong interest in **Data Science, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence**.

I focus on extracting insights from data, building predictive models, and understanding how intelligent systems learn and make decisions.  
Alongside my AI-oriented work, I have hands-on experience in **mobile application development**, which helps me approach problems with a full-stack and user-oriented mindset.

I enjoy combining **data-driven thinking**, **clean code**, and **practical problem solving** to build meaningful and scalable solutions.
